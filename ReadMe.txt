- This is my first single page application using following web technology:
A> HTML
B> CSS
C> Bootstrap
D> JavaScript & JQuery
E> AngularJS
F> JSON
G> AJAX
H> Flickr API

-> It has three pages which are as follow :
===> HOME : Which reads data from JSON and display on the page using AJAX call.
===> Calculator : Which calculates the interest rate based on the amount and rate provided by user dynamically using AngularJS.
===> Flickr : which asks user to enter the search string and get the images realated to search and display.
